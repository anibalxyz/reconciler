## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Java 21 (using embedded Jetty)
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose
- **Automation & Tooling**: GNU Make, custom `Makefile` for environment and workflow management

## Planned Features

- **Initial Setup**: Configure core parameters such as transaction sources, categories, and available log actions. This step is required only once after deployment.
- **User Authentication**: Basic login system using predefined credentials. Users can later update their password, but only admins can create or manage accounts.
- **Dashboard**: Central hub for navigating application features.
- **Transaction Upload**: Upload data from both bank and internal systems in supported formats.
- **Automated Reconciliation**: Automatically identifies matches and discrepancies between uploaded transactions.
- **Manual Discrepancy Resolution**: Interface for resolving unmatched or ambiguous records.
- **Admin Panel**: Admin-only section to add users and define new system parameters (e.g. categories, sources, action types).
- **Reports and Exports**: Export data in PDF, Excel, or other conventional formats.
- **Analytics and Charts**: Visualize financial activity, reconciliation rates, and trends.

## How to Run

### 1. Prerequisites

- **Git** (to clone the repository).
- **Docker v20.10+** and **Docker Compose v2+** (to run the application in a containerized environment).
- **Make** (available by default in most modern Linux distributions).
- **Java 21** (only if you plan to build or run locally outside of Docker).

### 2. Relevant Files

- `Makefile`: Contains commands to simplify developer workflow.
- `compose.yaml`: Defines the common base for all environments.
- `compose.<environment>.yaml`: Defines the specific environment configuration.
- `Dockerfile` & `Dockerfile.dev`: Define how to build the application image (currently only available for backend).
- `.env.<environment>.example`: Template for environment variables used in the application.

### 3. Commands and Workflow

All you need to work with this project is the `Makefile`. It provides a set of commands to manage the application lifecycle.
All commands are documented in the `Makefile` itself. You can view them by running:

```bash
make help
# Or just:
make
```

### 4. Running the Application

Follow these steps to run the application:

0. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anibalxyz/reconciler.git
cd reconciler

# Or if you prefer SSH:
git clone git@github.com:anibalxyz/reconciler.git
cd reconciler
```

1. Set the desired environment:

```bash
make set-env NEW_ENV=<environment>

# For example, to set the environment to 'development':
make set-env NEW_ENV=development
```

2. Bring up the application:

```bash
make up
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you have not created the `.env.<environment>` file yet, the command will automatically create it based on the `.env.<environment>.example` template. You will then be prompted to edit it using `nano` before starting the environment. In future releases, youâ€™ll be able to configure your own editor instead of nano. If you reject the prompt, the application will not start, and you will need to modify the `.env.<environment>` file manually.

3. Test the API:

```bash
curl http://localhost:<API_HOST_PORT>/api/health

# For example, if you set API_HOST_PORT=8081 in your .env file, you would run:
curl http://localhost:8081/api/health
```

You will receive a response like this if everything is working correctly:

```json
{
  "status": true
}
```

### 5. Stopping the Application

To stop the selected environment, you can run:

```bash
make down
```

### 6. Other Useful Commands

Apart from the commands used above, the `Makefile` provides several other commands with various functionalities. Some of the most useful ones include:

- `make logs`: View the logs of the application.
- `make rebuild`: Rebuild the API image.
- `make restart`: Restart the running containers (useful when changes were made in code during development).
- `make list-<scope>`: List Docker resources such as containers and images. You can also list all resources with `make list-all`.
- `make prune-<scope>`: Remove unused Docker resources such as containers and images. You can also remove all unused resources with `make prune-all`. Use with **caution**, as this will remove all stopped containers and unreferenced images.
