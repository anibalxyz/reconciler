## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Git** (to clone the repository)
- **Docker v20.10+** and Docker Compose v2+ (to run the application). **Do NOT use v5.x**
- **Python 3.10+** and **pip** (to use the CLI tool)

> [!WARNING]
> This project is designed to be run with Docker, which is the recommended and officially supported approach. Running services locally on your host machine is partially supported for **API and frontend** (mainly for development), but may require additional manual configuration.
>
> **For local development** (API and frontend services):
>
> - **Java 21** and **Maven**: To build and run the backend API
> - **Node.js 22+** and a package manager (`npm`, `pnpm`, or `yarn`): To build and run the frontend applications
> - **PostgreSQL Server**: A running instance for the application to connect to
>
> **Not supported for local execution** (Docker-only services):
>
> - **Flyway**: Database migrations must be run via Docker
> - **Nginx**: Production reverse proxy setup is Docker-only
>
> Local execution support for all services is not currently planned.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anibalxyz/reconciler.git

# All the following commands will assume you are in the project root
cd reconciler
```

### 2. Install the CLI

This project is managed by a powerful, custom-built command-line interface. The CLI provides a unified and intuitive way to manage the application's environments and lifecycle.

The CLI is a Python application. It is recommended to install it in a virtual environment.

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv ./cli/.venv
source ./cli/.venv/bin/activate

# Install the CLI in editable mode
pip install -e ./cli[dev]
```

```bash
# If you don't want to use editable mode
pip install ./cli
```

Thanks to [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/), the CLI is fully self-documented, so you can get help for any command or subcommand by simply adding `--help` to it.

```bash
# Try it out!
cli --help
```

### 3. Set Up The Environment

The CLI can manage different environments (e.g., `dev`, `prod`, `test`). Set your desired environment and initialize the configuration files in one go using the `--init` flag. This is the recommended way to get started.

```bash
# Syntax: cli set env <environment> --init
cli set env dev --init
```

This command will:

1. Persist the chosen environment in the `cli.cfg` file.
2. If they don't exist, create `.env.*` files from their `.example` templates and prompt you to edit them with `nano`.

### 4. Run the Application

First, build the Docker images for all services in the current environment.

```bash
cli image build all
```

Then, start the services using Docker Compose.

```bash
cli compose up all
```

### 5. Stop the Application

To stop and remove all running containers and networks, use `compose down`.

```bash
cli compose down all
```

### Accessing the Application

After running `compose up`, you can access the services at the following URLs.

> [!NOTE]
> The ports listed below are the default values defined in the `.env` files. If you change them, you will need to adjust the URLs accordingly.

| Environment | Service            | URL                      | Description                                      |
| :-----------| :------------------| :------------------------| :------------------------------------------------|
| `dev`       | API                | <http://localhost:4001/> | Swagger UI for API documentation                 |
| `dev`       | Public Site        | <http://localhost:5174/> | Login and registration pages                     |
| `dev`       | Dashboard          | <http://localhost:5175/> | Authenticated dashboard (requires login)         |
| `prod`      | Frontend via Nginx | <http://localhost/>      | Public site and dashboard                        |
| `prod`      | API via Nginx      | <http://localhost/api/>  | API and Swagger UI                               |

> [!TIP]
> To access the Dashboard, you'll need to log in through the Public Site first. A temporary Swagger UI link is available in the Dashboard for API exploration.
